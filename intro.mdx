TON Devnet is a dedicated test network for the TON blockchain, designed to provide developers and enthusiasts with a safe environment to experiment and validate transactions without using real funds. It mirrors the mainnet's architecture while introducing performance and scalability enhancements, enabling users to explore the network and test smart contracts in a realistic setting.

At its core, TON Devnet integrates a **hybrid transport layer** combining TCP and UDP, a **direct intershard commit mechanism**, and an **accelerated consensus protocol**. These innovations reduce latency, improve throughput, and simplify validator communication, providing a high-performance, low-overhead environment for both testing and experimentation.

By using the Devnet, developers can simulate real-world scenarios, monitor shard synchronization, and validate intershard interactions. With backward compatibility maintained, TON Devnet ensures that testing is safe, reliable, and closely aligned with mainnet behavior, making it an essential tool for anyone building or testing on the TON ecosystem.
